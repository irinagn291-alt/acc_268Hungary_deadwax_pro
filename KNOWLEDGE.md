# Craft

**Ship these. They are what made the real apps feel finished.**

- Home **is** the mechanic (canvas, rings, tower, wheel, matrix, dial, board, console). A tab plus a list of records is a clone. Mini-references are mechanics and density only — never type names, layouts, WebView, OneSignal, or betting chrome.
- Guideline 4.2 (Minimum Functionality): the App Store product is a native SwiftUI app with a persisted verb on device. A WebView, Safari sheet, site wrapper, or content catalog you could browse on the web is a reject. Push notifications, Core Location, and sharing do **not** make a browser into a product.
- One persisted verb on home. Unit-test that verb. A decorative Game / Aura / Circuit / Nest / Sweep tab is filler — do not ship one.
- Every primary list has an empty state: generated art, one headline, one line, one CTA as a **full page** (`frame(maxHeight: .infinity)`). A crumb in a `Spacer` fails.
- Generated art that sits on UI is a **cutout** (real PNG alpha, transparent corners). An opaque square plate inside a circle or pentagon fails. AppIcon / Splash / CardBackdrop fill the canvas.
- Screens fill the device. Unused flat field, a narrow text column, or a header-plus-void overlay is a fail. Edge-to-edge rows; the writing surface / list / hero uses remaining height. iPad uses the width. Simulator seed shows a **used** product (several cards, several lines of ink), not one stub row.
- Hit the whole chrome, not the glyph. Chrome lives **inside** the `Button` label with `.contentShape`. Min ~44pt. Rows, chips, cards, tab columns: one target.
- Onboarding Next / Continue / START is bottom, full width — not a 36pt control in the corner.
- Simulator seed only, once, behind a versioned key. Never seed on a device. Skip onboarding on Simulator after seed so home is not empty. Seeded home: primary verb enabled. Blocked twist is a test fixture, not the first frame.
- Background fills the safe area (no white strips). Tab bar sits on the home indicator; lists use `contentMargins(.bottom)`.
- Contact URL on Settings (or Goals). App Review looks for it.
- Health or product advice in the binary needs citations (tappable source links, easy to find). A "not medical advice" line without sources fails App Store 1.4.1. Catalog credit is a tappable source link, not a static OpenFoodFacts label.
- Camera scan (when used): include `.qr`; extract 8–14 digit runs from QR/URL; UPC-A pad; Simulator chips + manual; stop the session on disappear/background.
- Offline: if the product needs a catalog, a local shelf must catch empty/fail search. A spinner forever fails.
- Denied camera (when used) explains the state and routes to Settings. Silent no-op fails.
- Guideline 5.1.1 (when camera is used): the button before `requestAccess` is Continue or Next. "Allow camera" / "Enable camera" / "Grant camera" / bare Allow or Enable on that button is a reject. The system alert is the only Allow.
- Numbers go through `NumberFormatter`. Day edges use `Calendar.current.startOfDay`.
- One haptic on a successful commit, none on navigation.
- VoiceOver labels on every icon-only control. Colour is never the only signal.

**Anti-slop (taste kit). Defects, not suggestions.**

- No three identical equal-weight cards. One hero, then variance.
- No everything-centered. Asymmetry or a real grid.
- No em-dash or en-dash in UI copy. Period or comma.
- No elevate / unlock / seamless / effortless / supercharge / empower.
- No SECTION 01, FEATURE, Lorem, Your headline here.
- No emoji anywhere in the binary (labels, comments, assets copy).
- No 3-4pt tinted left-border on cards or alerts.
- No #000 on #FFF. Use the section 7.1 tokens.
- Neutrals carry the screen; accent is spice, one hit.
- Display type is short and wide (max ~4 lines, usually 1-2). Body ~17pt.
- Outer padding > card padding > inner gaps. Never invert.
- Adjacent home blocks do not share the same column structure.
- One radius language and one elevation language (section 7.4). No second kit.

**SwiftUI craft (from the kit adapter).**

- Colours, type, space, radius: one accessor each. No raw hex / magic pt in views.
- Primary Button uses a `ButtonStyle` with default, pressed, disabled, loading.
  Destructive actions use a destructive variant, not `action.primary` in red.
- Interactive views that apply: default, pressed, focused, disabled, loading,
  error, selected. Hover is press on iPhone.
- `@Environment(\.accessibilityReduceMotion)` gates travel. Fade stays.
- Dynamic Type: no clipped headlines at AX5. `@ScaledMetric` for custom sizes.
- Native `Button` / `Toggle` / `TextField`. A tappable `onTapGesture` card fails.
- Hit the whole chrome, `.contentShape`, min 44pt. Focus ring contrast 3:1.
- Token by intent: the live verb wears accent; delete does not.
- SF Symbols for chrome. Generated art is the brand, not a symbol-as-logo.

**UX writing.**

- Buttons frontload the verb: Save, Log, Scan. Not Submit or Click here.
- Empty: value, then action. Not 'No data'.
- Error: what, why if needed, how. A path forward or it is a dead end.
- Destructive confirm names the thing and the consequence.
- Voice is this app's DNA voice. Tone shifts (warm empty, plain error) but
  the voice does not.

**Design DNA — `duolingo` / warm / playful**
- Layout family: `play-tiles` — Mixed-size play tiles, one cutout, a fat CTA. Dead cells forbidden.
- Density: comfortable. Warm soft: friendly radii, comfortable pad, one playful moment.
- Motion `spring`: One spring on the commit (response ~0.4, damping ~0.8). Everything else is ease-out. Reduce Motion: fade, no spring.
- Voice `warm`: Human and brief. Empty states invite. Errors stay calm and useful.
- Type: Chunky display, short words, no long serif lines.
- Execute: Playful and tactile. Chunky primary. Progress is a shape plus a word, never a lone colour bar.
- Feel like the named system. Use this app's palette and radii. Do not copy their hex, type names, or web chrome.

**Review screenshots (21AUG App02–09)**

The running app, not `ImageRenderer`. One launch argument, three keys:

- `-ReviewScreen today` — home after onboarding (often a no-op)
- `-ReviewScreen log` — log / statement / planner
- `-ReviewScreen goals` — goals / targets / profile

Read `ProcessInfo.processInfo.arguments` **once**, **after** onboarding is done.
If onboarding is still showing, the hook never fires. The three keys must open
three **different** screens — same frame on today/log/goals is a miss.

Companion (Simulator only):

- Seed one demo day behind a versioned key (`{prefix}.demo.v1`).
- Mark onboarding complete in the same seed so the hook is reachable.
- `#if targetEnvironment(simulator)`. Never seed on a device.
- Seed fills the primary surface (four slot posts from the local shelf).
- Seed the happy path: home primary verb enabled. Blocked twist is a test fixture.

Driver (outside the app): build → install on iPhone and iPad → launch with the
argument → wait until the UI settles → `xcrun simctl io <udid> screenshot`.
Name files `{App}-{today|log|goals}.png`. Pick any available simulator UDID.

**The frame is the product. Rebuild a wrong screen. Do not patch pixels over it.**

- A stranger names the job and the next tap from home. A riddle headline fails.
- Seeded home: primary CTA enabled. Fake tappable cards and axis values as titles fail.
- Home **is** the mechanic, not a list of records. An empty or one-color frame fails.
- Guideline 4.2: native verb on device. A WebView / Safari / browse-only catalog fails. Push, location, and share do not count.
- Hit the whole chrome, not the glyph. Min ~44pt. `contentShape` on the fill.
- Unused canvas / narrow column — fill with this app's mechanic, not Spacer.
- Empty and onboarding are full pages, CTA at the bottom full width.
- Seed only Simulator + versioned key. Skip onboarding on Simulator after seed.
- Background fills the safe area. Contact URL on Settings.
- Home follows section 7.6 DNA. Three equal cards, em-dash copy, or emoji fail.

**Family `catalog_crate`**
- Home: Discover is a crate/wall, not a generic search app.
- Invariant (unit-test this): One external catalog. Stay in one domain. Rate + local notes. Scan only if the domain has a code.
- Empty: The crate is empty. Find the first title.
- Fake that fails: The same loop with a new API.
- Never: Add one rare verb: sleeve wall, quiz-from-crate, surprise-from-owned-stock, cook mode, or expiry rail — not all of them.

**Scan (camera families). Mechanics from the white book scanner — add `.qr`.**

Capture:
- AVFoundation session + Vision `VNDetectBarcodesRequest` (or `AVCaptureMetadataOutput` with the same set).
- Symbologies must include `.qr` plus `.ean13`, `.ean8`, `.upce` (Code 128/39/93 if the domain uses them). Linear-only misses QR packs and QR-encoded EANs.
- Permission: notDetermined → `requestAccess` (system alert is the first ask). A pre-screen is allowed only if the proceed button is **Continue** or **Next**.
- Guideline 5.1.1 reject: any CTA that directs the grant — `Allow camera`, `Enable camera`, `Grant camera`, `Allow camera access`, or a bare `Allow` / `Enable` / `Grant` on the button that calls `requestAccess`.
- Denied/restricted → copy + Open Settings (`UIApplication.openSettingsURLString`). Never a second Allow/Enable button.
- No capture device (Simulator): sample-code chips + mandatory manual field. Fully usable without a camera.
- Start the session on appear; `stopRunning` on disappear and on background.
- Cooldown 1.5–2.0 s after a decode. Skip frames (every 3rd is enough). Ignore the same payload while a lookup is in flight.
- Continuous autofocus / autoexposure when supported. `alwaysDiscardsLateVideoFrames`. Preview `resizeAspectFill`.

Payload (camera, typed, pasted URL):
- Keep digit runs of length 8–14. A QR/URL may be text — extract those runs; do not require the whole payload to be digits.
- 12-digit UPC-A → prefix `0`.
- Try every candidate before miss. EAN-8/13, UPC-A/E, QR carrying any of those.

**Mini-ref `PagePocket`** (`catalog_crate`)
- Steal: Catalog search, ISBN scan, crate/rate/notes, cover wall, empty search.
- Never: Alamofire wrapper, AppsFlyer, OneSignal, ContactUsWebView. Not book_quotes.
- Uniqueness: new home verb, new types, new layout. Do not reskin this ref.
